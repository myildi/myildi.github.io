title: Previewing Markdown on OSX with Marked
layout: post

So, I am learning [Markdown] using iAWriter and I have discovered a very nice tool for previewing my text as it will be typeset, once converted: [Marked]. Marked uses [MathJax] for previewing even your equations, written following the standard proposed by [Multimarkdown].
