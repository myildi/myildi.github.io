title: Switching to Google+
layout: post
---
Posterous does not accept autoposts by mail from/to Google Plus, so some of my articles can now only be seen on my G+ page. I am switching to G+

Moreover, given the complexity of managing Facebook, Twitter, a blog (Posterous was a potential solution for merging these streams) and now G+, I will progressively group everything in the latter stream.
You can read my Google+ stream from this address: [My GooglePlus](http://plus.yildizoglu.info).
