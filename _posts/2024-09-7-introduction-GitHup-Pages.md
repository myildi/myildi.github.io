title: Introduction to my new blog on GitHub Pages
---
I moved [my old blog] (http://yildizoglu.blogspot.fr) from _Blogger__ to ** [Scriptogr. am] (http://scriptogr.am/) ** some years ago. But now I would like to become completely autonomous, using  **[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll • Simple, blog-aware, static sites")**.

In the meantime, I have started to hear about **[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll • Simple, blog-aware, static sites")**, and the idea looked seducing to me, but I was not sure that the setup would be easy enough. I had some time to play with it, and it has been installed without any problem on my Mac. It was easy to convert older posts in Markdown to a Yaml format compatible with Jekyll. 

Now that GitHub Pages includes Jekyll, my process is even more straightforward: I write my posts in Markdown, commit them to Git, and push them to GitHub. They are magically converted to HTML pages on [my GitHub pages](https://myildi.github.io).
