tags: Cambodia MOEYS Education ETI

The Cambodian Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sport (MoEYS) is developing relevant strategies to address structural and financial challenges, but the scale of the education system necessary for a very young population requires much more significant efforts from public authorities.

**Education has been rising in national priorities in recent years**, but public authorities do not yet seem ready to fully commit to a path compatible with the announced development goals. The inadequacies of the education system have significant consequences in terms of human resources:

- 89% of jobs currently correspond to very low qualifications;
- 50% of companies report significant difficulties in recruiting for medium-skilled positions, such as technician roles.

**Significant resources are still needed** to generalize the implementation of reforms envisioned for primary and secondary levels. Despite two successive World Bank loans, the restructuring of higher education is not yet included in urgent priorities.

Human resources capacities at the MoEYS also require substantial and persistent investment, with recruitments commensurate with the challenges in higher education and research. Without these new capacities, the new Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (MISTI) risks taking control of academic research and creating additional coordination challenges within the Higher Education and Research sector.

#### Key Points:

1. **Demographic Challenge**: Cambodia's young population necessitates large-scale educational efforts.

2. **Funding Issues**: The education system faces significant financial constraints, particularly in higher education.

3. **Skills Gap**: There's a mismatch between the education system's output and the skills needed in the job market.

4. **Reform Implementation**: While strategies exist, their widespread application requires more resources.

5. **Higher Education Restructuring**: Despite World Bank loans, this remains a critical area that needs attention.

6. **Capacity Building**: The MoEYS itself needs investment in human resources to manage these challenges effectively

The complex challenges facing Cambodia's education system are considerable, and there is an essential need for continued, comprehensive efforts to improve educational outcomes and align them with the country's development goals. But if these needs are met, the young population of Cambodia will become a major asset in transforming the Cambodian economy and society. As such, education is definitely a **public good** and should be one of Cambodia’s main engines of growth.
