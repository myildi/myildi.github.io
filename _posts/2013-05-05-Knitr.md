title: Forget Sweave, long life to knitR!
--- 
I have at last had some time to play with **[knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/ "knitr: Elegant, flexible and fast dynamic report generation with R | knitr")**, which is an [R-project](http://www.r-project.org/ "The R Project for Statistical Computing") package written by Yihui Xie in order to correct some shortcomings of Sweave.  knitr is really much more convenient than Sweave and it integrates beautifully with [Lyx](http://www.lyx.org/ "LyX | LyX â€“ The Document Processor") (there is a module for knitr in recent versions of Lyx), *ggplot* and *tikzdevice* in R.

[Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ "RStudio - Home"), the very nice IDE for R-project also understands knitr out of the box. In this case, you also get and easy way of writing web pages containing results from R-project, since you can use Latex of Markdown for composing these pages and/or documenting your research.
If you frequently update a regularly published  report that uses data and statistics, you have a perfect setup in this framework (I am not in this case).

Knitr's web page is: [http://yihui.name/knitr/](http://yihui.name/knitr/)

Complementary information and manuals can be downloaded from its GitHub page: [https://github.com/yihui/knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr).

If you like Latex/Html and R-project, you should definitely check it.
