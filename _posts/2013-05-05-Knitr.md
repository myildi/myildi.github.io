title: Forget Sweave, long life to knitR!
--- 
I have finally had some time to play with **[knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/)**, an [R-project](http://www.r-project.org/) package written by Yihui Xie to correct some shortcomings of Sweave. knitR is much more convenient than Sweave, and it integrates beautifully with [Lyx](http://www.lyx.org/) (there is a module for knitR in recent versions of Lyx), *ggplot*, and *tikzdevice* in R.

[Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) is a very nice IDE for the R-project. It also understands knitR out of the box. In this case, you can also easily write web pages containing R-project results since you can use Latex of Markdown to compose these pages and/or document your research.
If you frequently update a regularly published report that uses data and statistics, you have a perfect setup in this framework (I am not in this case).

Knitr's web page is: [http://yihui.name/knitr/](http://yihui.name/knitr/)

Complementary information and manuals can be downloaded from its GitHub page: [https://github.com/yihui/knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr).

If you like Latex/Html and R-project, you should check it.
