title: The list of the notes and reports through my missions as an advisor
tags: Cambodia MOEYS Education ETI
---

Throughout my mission as an advisor to the Cambodian Minister of Education, Youth, and Sport since February 2020, I have written several notes and reports, as requested by H.E. the Minister. Some were in French (our primary communication language), and I have written others in English, given the target audience, which was not always francophone.

## The protocol

**The working method adopted for the analysis of these various subjects is as follows:**

1. **Inquiry by H.E. the Minister** on a particular issue.

2. Based on the subject’s needs, **review assessments and strategic documents** prepared by the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports (MEJS) regarding the issue to gain the most accurate understanding of the situation and MEJS priorities.

3. Review the international literature on the subject to develop a conceptual framework for better analyzing the issue and identifying best practices implemented in other countries.

4. **Meetings with actors** to better understand the reality of the situation and benefit from the experience of those directly involved.

5. Based on this information, **refine the initial analysis and diagnosis** of the situation and develop potential solutions to the identified bottlenecks in the system or suggest adjustments in its evolution.

6. **Drafting progress notes** on the various points, with recommendations on the specific issues.

7. **Where appropriate, consolidate these notes into a final report** containing a « recommendations »  section to serve as a reference document.

8. **Submit the notes and reports** to the Minister as completed.

9. **When necessary and feasible, communication of the report** to the relevant actors.

## A word cloud again

I asked ChatGPT to create a word cloud using these notes’ titles but eliminating ordinary English and French words.
