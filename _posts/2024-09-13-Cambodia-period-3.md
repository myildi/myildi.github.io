In this context, considerable challenges concern the overall and institutional level of the education system:

- A very young population:  **46% of the population being under 25 years old**, with huge educative needs and who can quickly transform the economy and society if well educated.

- But, **an aging teacher population with skills below the country's development ambitions**. Consequently, there is a need to rapidly and massively train new teachers with better-adapted skills.

- **Laws on higher education that are out of step with international standards** (lifetime rector positions, optional evaluation of universities, lack of precise academic structuring, especially for research), and a late and incomplete implementation (without clearly defined academic roles) of professorship statutes in higher education.

- **A teacher recruitment system that makes it challenging to allocate resources in primary and secondary education efficiently**, and a relatively archaic recruitment process in higher education through national examinations by broad fields or ministries.

- **Laws and circulars focusing more on formal aspects of education** rather than strengthening its fundamental role.

- **A siloed operation within the ministries and beyond** that makes it difficult to coordinate political action.

These are strong constraints that weigh on the strategies of the MOEYS and on actors in the field.
