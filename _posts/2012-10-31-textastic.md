**[Textastic](http://www.textasticapp.com)** is a magnificent text editor for iOS. And I have just discovered that it also handles Markdown very graciously.

Moreover, its perfect integration with Dropbox allows me to download a Markdon file, edit it and reupload it on the server with the push of a button. this last possibility expands its full pitential now that I am trying a Dropbox+Markdown+Scriptogr.am postd blog. I can nearly do everything in Textastic, except pushing the Synchorise button on the Scriptogr.am dashboard. I hope that this part will become automatic one day too. 

Textastic understands many language syntaxes and you can expand the set using modules from Textmate.
