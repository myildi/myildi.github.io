I have created a new course module for our doctoral students on LaTeX, LyX, bibTeX, Zotero, beamer and knitR (connection of LaTeX documents with R-project). The [webpage of this course](http://yildizoglu.info/ED-lyx-latex/index.html)  gives pointers for installing and setting up a LaTeX system for scientific writing and communication, as well as tutorials in French.
