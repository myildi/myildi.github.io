title: Platypus helps you to make your scripts more user-friendly
layout: post

I have just discovered a very nice tool. I was looking for a solution that would allow me to include software installed via MacPorts in my Applications menu. I was looking for more than a simple symbolic link to a bash script. Something nicer, with an icon and some interactivity. Then I have found a reference to Platypus on a forum.   

[Platypus](http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus) allows you to pack any command-line postd software into an .app bundle with a nice icon, or a droplet on which you can "drop" a set of files for batch processing.

You can bundle many different programs as an App: your scripts - Perl, Php, Python, AppleScript- , command line tools included in OSX or installed via MacPorts,etc. 
 
Platypus is quite simple to use and comes with nice and helpful documentation.
