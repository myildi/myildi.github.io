I have moved [my old blog](http://yildizoglu.blogspot.fr) from *Blogger* to **[Scriptogr.am](http://scriptogr.am/)** sometime ago. But now I am moving to a  **[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll â€¢ Simple, blog-aware, static sites")** based system that combines the advantages of Scriptogr.am and of complete autonomy, since the blog is hosted on my web site now:
