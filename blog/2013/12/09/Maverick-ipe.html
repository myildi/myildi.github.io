        <p class="postbody"><p>If you are trying to install the Macports version of ipe, after having installed OSX Mavericks, there is a big chance that the build will fail. There is a solution already developed by MacPorts developers as a patch file downloadable from <a href="http://trac.macports.org/ticket/41049">this page</a>. You can directly download this file following <a href="http://trac.macports.org/attachment/ticket/41049/ipe-cstdlib.patch">this link</a>.</p>

<p>With this file in your downloads (normally ~/Downloads) folder, open a terminal window and go to the ipe sources folder in your Macports tree (normally located under /opt/local) that remained after the failed install (type this instruction without line breaks):</p>

<pre><code>cd /opt/local/var/macports/build/    
_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_tarballs_ports_graphics_ipe/
ipe/work/ ipe-7.1.4/src/
</code></pre>

<p>and execute there </p>

<pre><code>patch -p0 &lt; ~/Downloads/ipe-cstdlib.patch
</code></pre>

<p>(check your Downloads folder that this patch file is there, before executing these instructions).</p>

<p>If the patch has been successful (otherwise you get an error message normally), you can try to install again now the ipe port by executing in the Terminal:</p>

<pre><code>sudo port install ipe
</code></pre>

<p>and the installation should start after you give the root password.</p>
