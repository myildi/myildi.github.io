        <p class="postbody"><p>I am starting to migrate to Mac OSX my working environment. I am an old Linux user for my servers but I have never been completely convinced by the Desktops for Linux (mainly KDE and Gnome) and gone back to Windows with the introduction of its first usable version (XP). I have deliberately missed the Vista wagon, and have not been impressed by Windows 7. Being tired by the quirks of XP, I wanted to adopt a more reliable and modern interface. OSX seems to me to comply with this demand, and the Unix that is behind the interface is quite a standard one, quite easy to understand for a person used to Linux. I am a happy camper concerning the very well thought interface of OSX.</p>

<p>Migrating my working environment to OSX has not been completely simple. Before the switch, I have, of course, checked that this migration is broadly possible. Here I indicate what was very simple, what was more bumpy, and the points for which I have not yet found a completely satisfactory solution.</p>

<h2 id="immediate-transition-for">Immediate transition for:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Internet tools, starting with Firefox (I really need it for <a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> and other tools that do not exist under Safari or Chrome);</li>
  <li>Latex compilation, just install TexLive, it is perfect.</li>
  <li>
    <p>For many aspects of Tex on OSX, check the <a href="http://mactex-wiki.tug.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">wiki</a>  </p>
  </li>
  <li>Simple Latex editors: <a href="http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/">TexMaker</a> is a very nice multi-platform editor. <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a> (Xemacs with an Aqua interface) comes standard with AUCTex, which a very powerful Tex editing and compiling tool.</li>
  <li>Graphical Latex editors: I was using <a href="http://www.lyx.org">Lyx</a> under Windows, there is an OSX version.</li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.mendeley.com">Mendeley Desktop</a> (very nice, bibtex compatible library manager) has an OSX version.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Statistical tools: <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R-project</a> offers an OSX version, perfect for me; it was my main tool under Windows. I am using <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a> also for R, since it comes with ESS (Emacs speaks statistics), which is also very powerful. <a href="http://gretl.sourceforge.net/osx.html">Gretl</a> (econometrics) works under OSX.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>Java programming: Eclipse works under OSX.</li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> works under OSX.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>Bitmap graphics: Gimp also offers an OSX version.</li>
  <li>Vectorial graphics: <a href="http://jpicedt.sourceforge.net">JPicEDT</a> is written in Java, so you can use it also under OSX, without any problem</li>
  <li>MS Office: I am using Office 2008.</li>
  <li>Picasa has an OSX version (I prefer it to iPhoto, probably because I am too lazy to replace an old software that satisfies me).</li>
  <li>Skype has on OSX version.</li>
  <li>Evernote works nicely with OSX.</li>
  <li>Freemind mind map software also works under OSX (Java).</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.zipeg.com">Zipeg</a> is a nice and free zip archive manager.  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="problems-begin">Problems begin:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>One difficult point has been to find a nice substitute to <a href="http://powerpro.webeddie.com">PowerPro</a> (this very nifty and talented swiss-army knife utility for managing many aspects of windows and automatizing many tasks). <a href="http://www.petermaurer.de/butler/">Butler</a> is able to replace some of them. I am learning AppleScript for some other aspects. Don’t call this an easy transition ;-)</li>
  <li>Lyx has problems to import some big Latex files I have written with Scientific Word, so I continue to use the latter under a Parallel’s virtual machine :-( I would really have an OSX version of SWP, even if I love Lyx…</li>
  <li>Unfortunately Entourage in Office 2008 is not compatible with Outlook (such a stupid strategy!); I am waiting Office 2010 that will reintroduce Outlook. I like quite well Apple-Mail but my several years old mail archive is under Outlook format and I do not want to loose mails during the conversion process…</li>
  <li>
    <p>Making <a href="http://www.inkscape.org">Inkscape</a> %2B <a href="http://pav.iki.fi/software/textext/">TexText</a> work under OSX has been a pain. I do not even remember how I have been able to do it (I have followed and mixed several forum post on this topic).  </p>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://tclab.kaist.ac.kr/ipe/">Ipe</a> graphics editor for Latex does not propose an OSX version out of the box. It seems possible to compile it for OSX, but I have not had yet the time to do it (it seems a little bit painful).</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.xara.com">Xara X</a> drawing software for vector graphics. I am really missing this one. I had to install it in the virtual machine.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nice-surprises">Nice surprises:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Bibliography management for bibtex: I like <a href="http://jabref.sourceforge.net">Jabref</a> (it is multi-platform), but <a href="http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net">Bibdesk</a> is a very nice reference management tool.</li>
  <li>Backup: Time machine is very nice and you have also nice imaging tools under OSX. You can use <a href="http://timesoftware.free.fr/timemachineeditor/">TimeMachineEditor</a> to customize some of its aspects. <a href="http://www.backblaze.com">Backblaze</a> also works for OSX and I have been able to transfer my subscription to the new machine without any problem (be just ready to loose all your old Windows backups).</li>
  <li>The Agenda of OSX is very nice and simply synchronizes with Google calendar.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.bean-osx.com">Bean</a> is a very nice and light Word file editor.</li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://skim-app.sourceforge.net">Skim</a> is a very useful free Acrobat viewer (and editor). Preview in OSX also very useful (deleting pages, etc.). <a href="http://code.google.com/p/formulatepro/">FormulatePro</a> allows the filling of Acrobat forms.  </p>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sebastian-krauss.de/software/#mymind">MyMind</a> is a very nice idea editor.</li>
  <li><a href="http://winebottler.kronenberg.org">WineBottler</a> (free) is a very nice Wine version that allows the installation of some small Windows programs under OSX. I have tested CrossOverX, but have not really been convinced by its advantages.</li>
  <li>OSX comes with many small and nice utilities (managing hard disk, writing DVDs, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I am using my virtual machine only for Scientific Word (only for some files, all new files are written under LyX or Aquamacs), Ipe and Xara X. I am quite happy with the coherent working environment provided by OSX. I am not ready to switch back to Windows for some time… :-)</p>
