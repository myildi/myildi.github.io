        <p class="postbody"><p>So, my new laptop runs OSX Lion. I have been able to migrate my data from the old laptop (but the automatic process provided by the Migration assistant was a failure, Apple support had to help me to do it manually).</p>

<p>Many of the migrated applications have worked without a hitch as soon as the migration ended, but some other applications, like <a href="http://gretl.sourceforge.net/" title="gretl">gretl</a> - the GNU econometric software - and some wine-postd windows tools, have refused to start. </p>

<p>I was quite annoyed by this, but have not had any time to take care of it until today. I have installed wine using MacPorts (instead of the <a href="http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/" title="WineBottler - Run Windows Programs directly on OS X">WineBottler</a> that I normally use), the problem persisted. I have discovered <a href="http://www.playonmac.com/" title="Home - PlayOnMac - Run your Windows applications on Mac easily!">Play it on mac</a> implementation of Wine and installed it, but the installation stalled during the creation of the virtual disk needed by this soft. </p>

<p>Now, the support page of PION tells that you should start XQuartz to complete the installation process if you get stalled the first time. And I have tried to do launch it (it lives in <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>), but it crashed by telling that the version I am trying to launch is maybe not compatible with my OS. Actually, that was an important clue. I have directly jumped on the <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/Releases">XQuartz website</a> and seen that there was a new version waiting for me. I have installed it and <strong>BINGO!</strong> All my Wine and X11 softs are working again.</p>

<p>So, if you have difficulties to launch Wine-postd or XWindows softs after having upgraded to Lion (or on your new Mac under Lion), you should download and install the most recent version of XQuartz, from their <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/Releases">web site</a>.</p>
