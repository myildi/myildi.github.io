        <p class="postbody"><p>I have been looking at the ways of editing LateX files on the iPad. There are already interesting LateX editor (<a href="http://www.vancapy.com/textouch/" title="TexTouch - vancapy">TexTouch</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tex-writer-latex-editor-compiler/id552717222?mt=8" title="TeX Writer - LaTeX Editor and Compiler for iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 …">TexWriter</a>  etc.), but I find them quite heavy to use yet, and Latex files are not very nice to decode on the small screen. </p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is a much simpler and readable tagging language invented by John Gruber (aka Daring Fireball). I have been tempted to play with it several times in the past, without really getting there. My preferred Latex editor is <a href="http://www.lyx.org">Lyx</a> now, but we are really not ready to get an iPad version of this very nice editor. So Markdown has seemed as an interesting possibility to explore for writing Latex in a nice editor as <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/" title="iA Writer">iAWriter</a>. Since  <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/" title="MultiMarkdown">MultimarkDown</a> offers quite efficient translation of Markdown to Latex (including the equations and figures), as week as other formats like HTML and OPML (useful for importing in <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/" title="Main Page -   FreeMind">Freemind</a>).</p>

<p>Here is my automatic setup for this workflow</p>

<ol>
  <li>synchronizing iAWriter documents between the iPad and my laptop sung iCloud;</li>
  <li>copying the file from the iCloud folder (~/Library/Mobile Documents/74ZAFF46HB~jp~informationarchitects~Writer/Documents) to a Dropbox folder each time it has been updated (with [Hazel]);</li>
  <li>converting the .md file in the Dropbox folder to Latex, HTML and OPML using Multimarkdown in Hazel, a soon as a new version if copied there;</li>
  <li>converting the Latex to pdf using by running pdflatex+bibtex+pdflatex twice).</li>
</ol>

<p>For the third step, I had to adapt the Multimarkdown latex support files to create a standard <em>article</em> export, instead of the <em>memoir</em> one used by default.</p>

<p>Now I can edit my documents on the iPad or on the MacBook using iAWriter and they get automatically synched and converted. If my MacBook is on, I can even get back the compiled PDF back on the iPad, using a Dropbox access (through GoodReader, for example).</p>

<p>I can give more details for this process if you ask for it in the comments.</p>
