title: Education Challenges in Cambodia, Part 4: Structuring Higher Education and Research in Cambodia

The higher education and research (HER) system in Cambodia suffers from significant weaknesses:

• **Low direct public funding** (the lowest in the region) has led to a de facto privatization of public universities through paid master's programs (despite the absence of scholarships for master's level students), in addition to a very strong presence of private institutions (80 out of 120), not always of satisfactory quality. Scholarships for deserving students at the bachelor's level only cover tuition fees, and 58% of these scholarship recipients cannot access university.

• A consequence of the previous point is the **difficulty in developing academic research**, which has no direct value in this HER "economy". Two successive loans (each for six years and 90 million USD) from the World Bank aim to support research. A third loan (60 million USD over five years) is in preparation. These loans are mainly dedicated to STEM fields and funding for new building construction, laboratory equipment purchases, and research projects through annual calls for proposals. However, there are concerns that without university restructuring, their effects may not be sustainable.

• **Insufficient structuring of universities** to develop and implement their strategies effectively. An exception is the Institute of Technology of Cambodia (ITC) which, thanks to support from a consortium of mainly French and Belgian universities and engineering schools, has implemented a remarkable process of structuring and continuous improvement. Cooperation with France plays an essential role in this development, notably allowing one or two ITC students to join École polytechnique each year.

• **Somewhat archaic recruitment processes for civil servant teachers**, leading to a skills deficit at the time of recruitment and a lack of continuous training for teacher-researchers, due to a lack of critical mass in each university. Only 8% of higher education teachers have a doctorate.

• **Often insufficient competency levels of university training** compared to Cambodia's development needs.

• **Difficulty in coordinating the management of HER institutions**, as they depend on seventeen different ministries.

These challenges highlight the need for comprehensive reforms and increased investment in Cambodia's higher education and research sector to improve its quality and relevance to the country's development needs.
